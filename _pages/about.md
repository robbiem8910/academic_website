Robbie is a PhD student in education economics at UCL. His current research focuses on evaluating the effects of T levels (a new high school qualification) on student achievement and social mobility, with a particular focus on students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Robbie’s masters in economics at the University of Waikato involved designing and conducting a field experiment to evaluate ways to increase volunteering for nature restoration groups. He has a broad range of research interests, including education, behavioural and environmental economics and wants to continue pursuing inter-disciplinary research to address some of society’s major challenges. Robbie is open to all questions and enquiries around his research and potential collaboration opportunities.
